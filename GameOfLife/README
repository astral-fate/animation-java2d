Inorder to create a grid square system, we will be drawing number of vertical & horizintal lines, just as we learned before as follows:

           g2.drawLine(0,0, 200,0);
           g2.drawLine(0,2, 200,20);
           g2.drawLine(20,0, 20,200);
           g2.drawLine(4,0, 4,200);

Only that it would take lots of time to draw number of lines
